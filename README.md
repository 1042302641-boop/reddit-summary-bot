# reddit-summary-bot
A simple Reddit utility bot that provides concise summaries for long posts and comment threads when invoked by users.

When a user mentions the bot in a thread (e.g., "u/MySummaryBot summarize"),  
it retrieves the publicly visible content from that specific thread and generates a short summary.

### Features
- Summarizes long posts or comment chains
- Only operates when directly mentioned by a user
- Does not collect or store data
- Does not scan across subreddits
- Responds only within the thread where it is invoked
- Fully compliant with Reddit's Developer and API policies

### Status
This project is currently under development.  
Full source code will be added once API access is approved.

### Purpose
To improve readability and convenience for Redditors by helping them navigate long discussions.

### Disclaimer
This bot does not perform moderation actions, voting, user analysis, or large-scale data collection.
